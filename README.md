The dataset comprises 1,000 student records with six variables: gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type,
test preparation course completion, and math scores. The dataset reveals the distribution of math scores across different demographic and socio-economic factors. 
The average math score is 66.09, with a standard deviation of 15.16, and scores range from 0 to 100. Analysis by parental education level 
shows that students with a master’s or bachelor’s degree have higher average math scores, suggesting a positive correlation between parental education and student performance. 
Visualizations of the data further highlight these trends and provide insights into how different factors affect math scores.
